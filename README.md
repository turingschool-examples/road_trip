```
User Story 2, Trips Show Page
​
As a visitor
When I visit a trips index page
And I click on a trips title
I’m taken to that trip’s show page
And I can see that trips title, destination city, mileage
And I also see a list of the names of the travelers that are on this trip
```

```
User Story 3, Remove a Traveler from a Trip
​
As a visitor
When I visit a trips show page
Next to each traveler’s name
I see a button to remove that traveler from the trip
When I click that button for a particular traveler
I am redirected back to the trips show page
And I no longer see that traveler’s name listed
```


```
User Story 4, Similar Trips
​
As a visitor
When I visit a trips show page
I see a section on the page titled, “Other Trips to this Destination”
And under that title I see a list of trip titles that have the same destination as this trip, but this should not include the trip who’s show page I’m on
And all of those titles are links to that trips show page
```
